### Prerequsites:
- (extremely recommended) github Desktop, GitExtentions, or something similar
- knowing the layout of SE mod files
- enough space to download the entire git repo (~5gb)?

### Step 1:
- ``Fork`` this repository to a folder on your computer. Name it something like SCModRepository-Yourname. This is where your edits can be made, and is apparently how actual projects do it.

### Step 2:
- ``Make a branch`` for the changes you want to do on ``your local repository``. (i.e. SCModRepository-Yourname/BuffMyFavoriteGunPlease) Use your local repository's ``Main`` branch to keep in sync with starcore's ``Main`` branch, it makes edits much easier. You just click the button on github to sync it.

### Step 3:
- To test your changes ingame, Copy the mod you want to edit to your ``%Appdata%/SpaceEngineers/Mods`` folder.
 
### Step 4:
- Make your edits and throw it back in the repository folder. you can use the ``.bat file`` included in the repository to link your local Space Engineers mods with the ones in the repository.

### Step 5:
- Submit a pull request so that the branch can be merged into the SCModRepository/Main one.
- You can merge your PR yourself if you're confident, or ask for review. Once merged, the development version of the mod will automatically be updated.

Note - the `Main` branch is for the ModDev world, and `Stable` is for the primary combat and build worlds. `Stable` pushes are done in bulk after Test Tournaments.
